# Hey! So, you're viewing my profile... heres some info about me.

### 🔭 What am I working on?
I've got a Discord-StackOverflow hybrid in the works. As soon as I get a PC, I'll be doing lots and lots of game development.

### 🌱 Ok, what are you learning?
Aren't we all still learning? But on a more serious note, I'm learning react native and still learning Objective-C as I continue making tweaks.

### 👯 Cool, who do you want to collab with?
I'm currently working with a team on a next level Discord-StackOverflow hybrid. The [Helselia Team](https://github.com/Helselia) is comprised of tweak developers, designers, bot developers, and me!

### 🤔 So, are you looking for help?
Actually, yeah I am! If anyone has some React Native tips or Objective-C tips, I'd love to hear them!

### 💬 Ask me about...
Almost anything JavaScript related. I'm really great at JavaScript so I *might* be able to answer your question!
