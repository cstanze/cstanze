## Hiya there 👋

I'm human. I breathe, I eat, I sleep. Most importantly, I code ⚡️

### 🔭 What am I working on?

I'm doing solo work on a language compiler for my very own language! As soon as I get a better PC, I'll also be doing lots of game development.

### 🌱 What are you learning?

Aren't we all still learning?

### 🤔 Are you looking for help?

Actually, yeah I am! If anyone has some LLVM tips or C++ tips, I'd love to hear them!
